      "initDate": "11/2021",
      "finishDate": "03/2022",
      "description": "In a Microwave Oven production line, one of the positions is dedicated to the Assembly and Fixing of Transformers. In this position, the operator moves a transformer from the corresponding Pallet to a Bolting Support. This transformer weighs between 3.5Kg and 5Kg, and in order to place it on the support the operator has to make a 90° turn, which is not recommended ergonomically speaking. In order to prevent injuries to the operator, a Collaborative Robot (Cobot) was added to the workplace to help the operator with repetitive tasks and lifting Heavy Loads. Using a camera that performs image processing, the robot detects the transformer on the pallet and reaches it to the screw support. To carry out the project, it was necessary to budget the project, re-design the job, program the collaborative robot, model in 3D and make the additional clamp that lifts the transformer, program the camera that detects the transformer, make the button panel for handling of the cobot together with its electronics and installing the collaborative robot with its respective follow-up until it works correctly. This was a team effort that was carried out in conjunction with all areas of the Company (Automation and Test Engineering, Process Engineering, Production, Logistics, Medical Service, Safety and Hygiene, and operators).",
